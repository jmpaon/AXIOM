# EXIT -- Express Cross-Impact Technique

**EXIT** is a Java program that performs 
an EXIT (Express Cross-Impact Technique) style
cross-impact analysis 
on an input file containing a cross-impact matrix 
which describes the direct impacts between variables.

The main output of the EXIT calculation
is a new cross-impact matrix which describes 
the summed direct and indirect impacts
that are mined in the EXIT calculation process
on the basis of the input matrix.
A number of transformations 
on both input and result matrices
can be helpful in interpreting and analysing the results.
